Accept crypto payments with instant Naira settlement, Zendfi is built specifically for African developers

ZendFi is a payment gateway that enables African developers to easily accept USDC/SOL payments via Solana while receiving instant Naira settlements. My goal with Zendfi is to address the unique challenges of African markets including crypto complexities, local banking integration, and currency volatility.
